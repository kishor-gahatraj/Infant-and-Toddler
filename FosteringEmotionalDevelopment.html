      <h3>Introduction of Fostering Emotional Development</h3>
      <p>
        Emotional development is the emergence of the experience, expression,
        understanding, and regulation of emotions from birth and the growth and
        change in these capacities throughout childhood, adolescence, and
        adulthood. The development of emotions occurs in conjunction with
        neural, cognitive, and behavioral development and emerges within a
        particular social and cultural context (Izard and Trentacosta 2020,
        para. 1) Teaching Competencies and Skills . Children learn best in the
        context of warm, positive, respectful, caring and responsive
        relationships (Evans &amp; Harvey, 2012). Teachers need to actively
        develop their relationships with young children and their families
        (Bary, 2010). . Creating a Positive Climate: Setting a positive climate
        helps children feel safe and secure in their environment. Climate refers
        to the prevailing mood, attitudes and tone that teachers, families and
        children feel when they are in the early childhood setting. When there
        is a positive climate and children feel good, they are more likely to
        interact with others. . Teachers can help children build confidence and
        develop a positive self-identity. It is important to note that
        confidence and positive self-identity are learnt skills which develop
        over time. . Show respect for children and build them up in a positive
        and authentic way. This might include letting children know about the
        things that you think makes them interesting and unique, asking children
        to talk about what they like about themselves, and modelling a positive
        self-identity by talking about what you like about yourself. Techniques
        for nurturing Emotional Development, Learning and Wellbeing Create
        environments where all students feel valued and supported by sta and
        peers. Students are then more likely to build on this feeling of
        belonging by connecting further with their school community. They are
        also more likely to experience increased feelings of competence,
        engagement, and intrinsic motivation to learn, pursue their interests,
        and thrive. Providing clear structure and routines, and access to safe
        spaces, are particularly important for students who experience mental
        health challenges, or who have experienced trauma or adverse childhood
        experiences (Trauma and Resilience Educator Project,2023) Secure,
        respectful, and reciprocal relationships lead to students’ increased
        engagement in learning, prosocial behavior, feelings of safety at
        school, and reduced depression, anxiety and stress. Modelling positive
        coping and emotion regulation strategies in the classroom (Herald
        Sun,2023)

       <h3>Authentic Curriculum plan and examples</h3> 
        Art<br/>
        Children create self-portraits showing a specific feeling (e.g., joy, frustration) and share
        the story behind it. This activity encourages self-awareness as children can identify their
        feeling and reflect on what caused the emotion.<br/>
        Drama and Puppetry:<br/>
        Educator can use puppets to model emotional challenges. This activity helps children
        observe emotion like sadness, frustration, and learn to identify in other. This activity also
        encourages children to think cooperatively.<br/>
        Movement and music<br/>
        Encourage children to work on team or create group dance where they can make body
        movement following the rhythm where each body movement, gestures which represent
        di erent kind of emotion.<br/>

                  Mirror plays<br/>
                  Activity: For this activity we can place mirror on the eye level of baby during tummy time
                  or on the floor. As baby see on the mirror educator can make di erent faces looking in
                  the mirror or copying the expression baby are making and talk about the expressions
                  with baby that is seen in the mirror.<br/>
                  Outcome: This activity helps babies to identify themselves. By looking their own
                  reflection and facial expression, they can learn to associate facial expressions with
                  emotions. It helps to encourage and foster bonding with educators.<br/>

                Emotion sorting game<br/>
        Activity: For the activity we need some simple emotion cards like happy, sad and angry
        and some bins or containers with matching emotion colors. Educator can show card to
        toddler and ask them to put in the container like for example “this is happy face it should
        go in yellow bin”.<br/>
        Outcome: This activity helps to develop a toddler deeper understanding of how emotion
        look like. As toddler are sorting and placing the cards on the bins it also helps to
        develop their fine motor skills. It also supports their language development as they
        name the emotion they see.<br/>

        For 2 to 3 years<br/>
        Musical emotion chair<br/>
        Activity: For this activity we need to set up some chair labeled with emotion. After that
        we can play a music and once a music is stopped children need to sit down on the chair
        and express the emotion that are labeled in the chair they are sitting.
        Outcome: This activity allows children to express their emotion through body language
        and movement. It helps them to better understand about how emotion feel on their body
        and how they can express. The activity also fosters gross motor skills as children move
        around on the combination of music.<br/>
