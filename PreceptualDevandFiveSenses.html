      <h3>Introduction to Perceptual Development</h3>
      <p>
        Infants and toddlers learn to understand sensory information they detect
        through eyesight together with hearing and touching and tasting and
        smelling. The sensory experiences enable children to develop
        self-awareness together with social awareness and environmental
        understanding (Sheridan et al., 2011). The early childhood stage depends
        exclusively on sensory perception to both discover and comprehend and
        answer to the world around them. A child's perceptual development
        requires secure spaces which contain sensory-stimulation opportunities
        for feeling observations through touch and seeing through eyes and
        hearing sounds and tasting substances and sensing scents (Berk & Meyers,
        2019). Teachers are essential in observing child responses to select
        appropriate sensory learning experiences which lead to meaningful
        outcomes. Children's education through perceptual development leads to
        meaningful environments by supporting the principles of belonging and
        being and becoming (Department of Education, 2022; Roth et al., 2019)
        according to the Early Years Learning Framework (EYLF).

          <h2>Teaching Competencies and Skills</h2>
          Educators have a leading role in perceptual development through their work 
        towards building sensory-stimulating learning spaces as well as their active 
        engagement with children (Gartrell, 2020). For developing this competency 
        successfully one must acquire specific abilities and important skills.
          The assessment of comfort levels and preferences can be achieved through 
        monitoring sensory responses of children (Sheridan et al., 2011).
          The provision of appropriate sensory elements such as fabric together with 
        water and sand and lighting and natural items supports multisensory learning 
        (MacBlain, 2021).<br/>
          You can boost language development together with cognitive skills by being 
        perceptive toward sensory experiences of children and intentionally using 
        verbalization ("You felt cold water") (Berk & Meyers, 2019).<br/>
          Daily teaching approaches must provide an environment balanced for senses 
        through dedicated quiet and active play areas to serve students with di erent 
        needs (Curtis & Ohagan, 2019).<br/>
          Daily nappy changes and snack times and outdoor play sessions serve as 
        opportunities where performers can present di erent smells and sounds and 
        textures that enhance learning within the daily caregiving schedule (Raising 
        Children Network, 2023).<br/>

                  Position various texture pieces of silk cloth with felt and bumpy rubber and cotton 
                fabric on a surface. Set the baby down in a resting position with their stomach up 
                or seating while they can reach and feel di erent textured materials.
                  The goal involves activating touch senses to help infants explore their environment 
                through touch.<br/>

                    Early sensory exploration becomes possible at this activity because babies 
                    experience di erent textures through tactile stimulation which is important to 
                    their perceptual development as well as their understanding of their surroundings 
                    in their initial stage of life (Sheridan et al., 2011; MacBlain, 2021).<br/>

                    Description: Provide sealed containers filled with di erent materials (rice, bells, 
                    beads, lentils). Let toddlers shake and compare sounds. Encourage them to guess 
                    what's inside.<br/>
