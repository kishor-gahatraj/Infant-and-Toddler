        Introduction of Promoting Infant and Toddler Development, Learning, and
        Wellbeing
      </h3>
      <p>
        The foundation for promoting development alongside learning and
        enhancing wellbeing among infants and toddlers depends on environments
        designed to help their emotional and cognitive and physical and social
        growth. Educators must practice responsive caregiving by observing
        individual child needs to develop secure attachments and positive
        emotional health (Berk & Meyers, 2023). Early childhood education
        organization relies on play-based learning as its essential framework to
        let children build their investigative practices and innovative thinking
        capabilities while learning to solve problems. The learning experiences
        prepared by educators enable children to build their language abilities
        and social competencies by providing meaningful peer connections
        (Department of Education, 2022). The Reggio Emilia and Pikler approaches
        formulate environments to enhance children's learner autonomy and
        promote both respect and their active learning roles (Gandini 2012;
        Gerber 2002). According to the Early Years Learning Framework (EYLF)
        educators need to construct a feeling of belonging and being alongside
        becoming to promote complete wellbeing as well as early developmental
        foundations (Department of Education, 2022) .
