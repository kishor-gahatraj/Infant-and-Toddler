      <h3>Introduction of Facilitating Language and Literacy Development</h3>
      <p>
        Infants along with toddlers experience maximum growth in language
        proficiency from environments that provide ample opportunities for
        speaking and listening in addition to conversing tasks which promote
        language abilities and literacy abilities. Listening sessions that
        include reading and meaningful conversations combined with developmental
        experiences of early reading and dialogic learning build future literacy
        abilities (Berk & Meyers, 2023; Whitehurst et al., 2021)

    <h2>Authentic curriculum examples</h2>
    <h3>Art: Sponge painting</h3><br/>
    The art activity allows children to work with big sheets of paper and primary colors during 
    which they try sponge painting techniques. The creative painting activity enhances children's 
    sensory development as well as their hand-eye coordination and lets them show their 
    individuality. This activity allows toddlers to explore artistic freedom during their creative 
    experiments with both colors and textures according to Edwards (2022).<br/>
    Languages: Shared Reading book<br/>
    When the teacher read Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See to the class it enhanced 
    listening skills as well as language comprehension and future thinking capabilities. Children 
    build basic reading confidence and phonological awareness skills when they both repeat and 
    predict phrases according to Whitebread & O'Sullivan (2021).<br/>
    Science: Exploring sensory<br/>
    Children during their toddler stage observe ice cubes as they melt gradually throughout 
    periods of time. The physical interaction with ice cubes helps children develop questions 
    about changes they observe alongside predictive abilities and knowledge of relationships 
    between factors. Sensory activities enable children to form basic scientific understanding 
    while becoming curious about transformation in nature (Blaisdell et al., 2022).<br/>
    Movement: <br/>
    The soft indoor course provides toddlers with climbing and crawling opportunities through 
    slides. The obstacle course helps develop gross motor skills in addition to balance abilities 
    and perception of space. Physical growth becomes better through active play because 
    movement investigation builds self-confidence (Gagen & Getchell, 2023).<br/>

              <h3>2. 0 to 12 months: </h3>
    Activity Title: Sensory Basket Discovery<br/>
    Activity: The shallow basket should contain several safe textured items such as a soft cloth 
    and a wooden spoon and a silicone teether and crinkly paper. The infant needs both a soft 
    mat for lying down and supportive sitting while reaching and touching di erent objects under 
    adult supervision.<br/>
    Outcome: Sensory Basket Discovery serves essential developmental areas for children 
    between 0 to 12 months. Through this activity infants acquire cognitive competencies 
    because they learn to detect multiple textures and colors and shapes which develops their 
    problem-solving and cause-and-e ect learning abilities. Infant sensory growth becomes 
    stronger while they touch various textures (soft, rough and smooth) and use rattles for 
    audiotory engagement. The activity helps develop motor abilities by teaching infants to use 
    their upper body to grasp objects and reach for them along with object manipulation. 
    Through this activity language development occurs because caregivers teach new words 
    while the baby learns to match sounds to physical objects. The social-emotional 
    development of the infant improves because the activity creates a bonding experience which 
    strengthens trust and security between the caregiver and child.<br/>

              <h3> 3.12 to 24 Months:</h3>
    Activity: During picture book reading sessions the caregiver should point out images while 
    naming visible objects.<br/>
    Outcomes: During Storytime the children gain new words while learning to recognize 
    connections between words and objects. The cognitive development of the child strengthens 
    through recognition when they identify familiar objects and actions in pictures. Both the 
    child and the caregiver create social bonds through this development activity while they read 
    the book together.<br/>

    2 to 3 years<br/>
    Activity: Finger Painting<br/>
    Childhood finger painting provides toddlers with creative satisfaction along with essential 
    development of their sensory abilities and their hand function. Children can freely paint with 
    non-toxic products either to draw specific pictures or to learn from touching and spreading 
    paint across their hands. During paint activities youngsters develop their fine motor 
    capabilities through their work with paint because this action aids them in grasping 
    movements in addition to hand-eye coordination and finger skills. The activity supports 
    cognitive learning through color experimentation which helps children understand cause
    e ect relationships when they notice how pressing their fingers makes marks in painted 
    surfaces. The making of art during toddlerhood helps children share their feelings through 
    painting activities.<br/>
    Outcomes: The process of using fingers to paint teaches toddlers to control their hands while 
    dealing with paint which develops perfect coordination between eyes and hands and 
    strengthens finger muscles. The hands-on experience with mixtures while creating marks 
    allows children to develop an understanding of cause and e ect and color relationships as 
    well as cognitive abilities. The emotional aspect of finger painting enables toddlers to express 
    their feelings through artwork which helps build their self-confidence as well as their 
    expression abilities.<br/>
