      <h3>Introduction of Teaching Infant and Toddler Education</h3>
      <p>
        The essential aspects of teaching infants and toddlers involve
        developing secure relationships and delivering plenty of play-based
        learning situations which enhance overall child development. Educators
        build childhood development through well-designed routines along with
        purposeful teaching together with attentive classroom exchanges. Early
        learning processes require social connections and physical surroundings
        with practical experiences according to sociocultural theory by Vygotsky
        and sensorimotor stage research by Piaget and psychosocial development
        work of Erikson and ecological systems model of Bronfenbrenner [Berk &
        Meyers, 2023]. By combining the Pikler method with the Reggio Emilia
        approach educators create caregiving practices which focus on respect
        together with autonomy and curiosity (Page et al., 2022). The Early
        Years Learning Framework (EYLF) V2.0 gives Australian teachers a pathway
        to support children by developing their sense of belonging and their
        being and becoming (Department of Education, 2022) <br />

      <h3>Teaching Infant and Toddler Education</h3>
      <p>
        Infant and toddler education focuses on building relationships and
        creating responsive practices that boost playing activities and normal
        routines and secure attachment bonds for child development. Through
        observing and responding to children's needs teachers help young
        learners build firm self-identity and connection to others. The learning
        processes in early childhood align with social engagement and holistic
        development per the modern views of Vygotsky and Piaget and
        Bronfenbrenner (Berk & Meyers, 2023). The Pikler method together with
        the Reggio Emilia approach enhance caregiver practices by enabling
        children to grow independently while investigating through thoughtful
        nurturing approaches (Page et al., 2022). The Australian EYLF V2.0
        delivers purposeful instructional approaches to advance learning
        development alongside physical well-being alongside cultural respect for
        students from all backgrounds as described in the Department of
        Education (2022).
