      <h3>Introduction of Fostering Social Development</h3>
      <p>
        Early childhood social development is the process through which young
        children learn how to communicate with others, control their emotions,
        and cultivate social skills. These abilities include the capacity for
        good communication, sharing, taking turns, and empathy. (Gordon &amp;
        Browne, 2022). Understanding social standards and developing
        relationships with classmates, adults, and even siblings are other
        aspects of social development. Teaching competencies and skills:
        1.Educators can build a welcoming and warm learning community by
        demonstrating respect, listening skills and positive expectations about
        respectful and caring behaviour (Essa &amp; Burnham, 2019). Use everyday
        interactions as learning opportunities 2.Promote deeper thinking by
        creating an environment where children feel safe can assist them to
        state their opinions and reasons (Sheridan et al., 2020). 3.Encourage
        children to use e ective verbal and non-verbal communication skills
        while interacting within the learning community (Gordon &amp; Browne,
        2022). 4.By discussing moral issues and listening to a range of views,
        children and young people can build awareness and understanding of
        diversity

        Authentic Curriculum plan and examples<br/>
        Art:<br/>
        Activities like Collaborative painting or group collage helps promote sharing and teamwork,
        develop to work cooperatively, have a patience to take a turn. Children learn to share
        materials with their friend and respect other ideas (Sheridan et al., 2020).
        Drama and puppetry:<br/>
        Dramatic play scenario encourages children to play cooperatively, understand roles and
        responsibilities. Children can develop communication skills. Through imaginative play they
        can reflect real life experiences. Children can learn practicing social scripts like greetings,
       asking for help (Mooney, 2017; Gordon &amp; Browne, 2022).<br/>
        Mathematics and Numeracy<br/>
        To develop children math skills through action we can set up activity like playing board
        game. This activity develops number sense and counting skills. Helps children understand
        basic addition and subtraction through movement. Also, they learn the concepts of more or
        less and in order (Essa &amp; Burnham, 2019).<br/>
        Movement and music<br/>
        Group dance<br/>
        For the activity we need open space, age-appropriate music and some props like ribbons for
        expressive dance. The objective of this activity is to build confidence of children and practice
        self-regulation, patience, and empathy in a group setting. The activity promotes cooperation
        as well (Berk &amp; Meyers, 2018).<br/>
        Science<br/>
        Group investigation of a nature topic<br/>
        It is a flexible activity for children where they explore outdoor area looks at the nature,
        collect bugs and share their findings. From this activity they are connected to nature. They
        develop their observation skills by exploring around the living things (Gordon &amp; Browne,
        2022).<br/>
