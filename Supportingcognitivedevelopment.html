      <h3>Introduction of Supporting Cognitive Development</h3>
      <p>
        Understanding cognitive development in Early Years Cognitive development
        refers to the growth and maturation of all thinking processes, including
        perceiving, concept formation, remembering, problem-solving, imaging and
        reasoning. Cognitive development means how children think, explore and
        figure things out. It is the development of knowledge, skills, problem
        solving and dispositions, which help children to think about and
        understand the world around them. Brain development is part of cognitive
        development. Cognitive Development in Infants and Toddlers Cognitive
        development of children in the first years of life is complex. During
        their first three years of life, children learn faster than they will
        ever learn again. They are actively collecting and arranging information
        about their environment. Young children learn about their social
        surroundings by engaging with others. They start to grasp basic concepts
        through their senses: seeing, touching, hearing, smelling, tasting, and
        moving (Sheridan et al., 2020). Toddlers become more aware of details
        and distinctions in their environment and develop an interest in more
        intentional play (Gordon &amp; Browne, 2022). Piaget and Vygotsky are
        two well-known theorists of cognitive development. According to Piaget
        theory he suggests that suggests that children&#39;s intelligence
        undergoes changes as they grow. Whereas Vygotsky theory suggest that
        learning does not happen in isolation:instead, it is influenced by
        social interactions with more knowledgeable others, such as parents,
        teachers, or peers (Mooney, 2017)
      </p>

        Teaching Competencies and Skills<br/>
        1.Educator must have knowledge of typical development milestone across four key domains:
        cognitive, social, emotional, and physical. So that educator has ability to recognize individual
        di erence in learning pace (Gordon &amp; Browne, 2022).<br/>
        2. Educator can create developmentally appropriate learning environments, like safe and
        organized room space where children can move freely, independently which encourage active
        learning that promotes their curiosity, creativity and problem solving (Essa &amp; Burnham, 
       2019).<br/>
        3.Educator can encourage them to do pretend play which help in developing children thinking
        and problem-solving skills through imaginary skills such as pretend to be doctor or playing
        house or cooking. These activities encourage children to think creatively and solve the 
       problemduring play (Berk &amp; Meyers, 2018).<br/>
        <h3>Authentic Curriculum plan and examples</h3>
        Art<br/>
       Teaching approach: Encourage children to express their thought, emphasizes creativity,
        decision making and exploration of materials.<br/>
        Examples: Exploratory painting by using natural and recycled materials for children to 
       develop their decision making and thinking.<br/>
        Drama and Puppetry:<br/>
        Teaching approach: Support problem solving, storytelling helps to develop memory and
        understand language also encourage flexible thinking and creativity of children.
        Example: Using puppets, role play scenario promote thought and empathy also build memory
        skills.<br/>
        Movement and Music:
        Teaching approach: Activities like obstacle course helps in physical developing along with
        cognitive development.<br/>
        Example: During the action song and dance allow children to have free movement and self
       expression. T help children to recognition of rhythm.<br/>
        Mathematics and Numeracy:<br/>
        Teaching approach: Helps in number sense development by connecting math to real-life
        Example: Activity like cooking with measurement, real world math task which build
        understanding.<br/>
        Language and Literacy<br/>
        Teaching approach: Increase vocabulary and building on childrenâ€™s natural intersts in print.
        Example: Reading book-based inquiry, story mapping and retelling<br/>
        Learning experience<br/>
        <h3>1. Birth to 0 to12 months</h3>
        Experiences: Treasure Basket Exploration<br/>
       This activity can be applicable for birth to 12 months especially ideal for 6 to 12 months. This
        activity supports babies&#39; cognitive development by providing multisensory experience 
       which encourages exploration for babies. The variety of things in the basket helps them to develop
       their concentration skills. It also develops babies hand eye coordination and fine motor skills. 
       It o ers the opportunity to stimulate all the babies five senses.<br/>

                Experience: Pretend play<br/>
                This activity is setup by pretending a kitchen where toddlers are encouraged to cook food, 
                feed babies. This activity focus on child thinking and memory. It encourages creativity and
                imagination where they can enhance their problem solving and flexible thinking. Children get
                connected with people, places, technologies and natural materials through their own learning.

        Experience: Block builders<br/>
        This activity can be done by using blocks to build towers, or any imaginative structures. This
        activity boost children confident and make them feel safe to explore materials and try new
        idea. Children can improve their problem-solving skill by figuring out how to make or stack the
        blocks. They can learn about size, color or shape while sorting the blocks.<br/>
